# Breast-cancer-prediction
This project analyzes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset to classify tumors as malignant or benign using machine learning techniques. It includes data exploration, preprocessing with feature scaling, and splitting into training and testing sets. Three classifiers—Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Logistic Regression—are implemented with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV and nested cross-validation for optimal performance. Models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Cohen’s Kappa, with results visualized through confusion matrices. The project leverages Python libraries such as Pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to deliver reliable and interpretable classification outcomes.
